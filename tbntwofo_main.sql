I\'m a committee member within the Liberal Party of Canada. I sit within several committee groups but the information I am providing is originating from the Strategic Planning committee (which is steered by the PMO).\r\n\r\nI need to start off by saying that I\'m not happy doing this but I have to. As a Canadian and more importantly as a parent who wants a better future not only for my children but for other children as well. The other reason I am doing this is because roughly 30% of the committee members are not pleased with the direction this will take Canada, but our opinions have been ignored and they plan on moving forward toward their goals. They have also made it very clear that nothing will stop the planned outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe road map and aim was set out by the PMO and is as follows:\r\n\r\nPhase in secondary lock down restrictions on a rolling basis, starting with major metropolitan areas first and expanding outward. Expected by November 2020.\r\n\r\nRush the acquisition of (or construction of) isolation facilities across every province and territory. Expected by December 2020.\r\n\r\nDaily new cases of COVID-19 will surge beyond capacity of testing, including increases in COVID related deaths following the same growth curves. Expected by end of November 2020.\r\n\r\nComplete and total secondary lock down (much stricter than the first and second rolling phase restrictions). Expected by end of December 2020 - early January 2021\r\n\r\nReform and expansion of the unemployment program to be transitioned into the universal basic income program. Expected by Q1 2021.\r\n\r\nProjected COVID-19 mutation and/or co-infection with secondary virus (referred to as COVID-21) leading to a third wave with much higher mortality rate and higher rate of infection. Expected by February 2021.\r\n\r\nDaily new cases of COVID-21 hospitalizations and COVID-19 and COVID-21 related deaths will exceed medical care facilities capacity. Expected Q1 - Q2 2021.\r\n\r\nEnhanced lock down restrictions (referred to as Third Lock Down) will be implemented. Full travel restrictions will be imposed (including inter-province and inter-city). Expected Q2 2021.\r\n\r\nTransitioning of individuals into the universal basic income program. Expected mid Q2 2021.\r\n\r\nProjected supply chain break downs, inventory shortages, large economic instability. Expected late Q2 2021.\r\n\r\nDeployment of military personnel into major metropolitan areas as well as all major roadways to establish travel checkpoints. Restrict travel and movement. Provide logistical support to the area. Expected by Q3 2021.\r\n\r\nAlong with that provided road map the Strategic Planning committee was asked to design an effective way of transitioning Canadians to meet a unprecedented economic endeavor. One that would change the face of Canada and forever alter the lives of Canadians.\r\n\r\nWhat we were told was that in order to offset what was essentially an economic collapse on a international scale, that the federal government was going to offer Canadians a total debt relief.\r\n\r\nThis is how it works: the federal government will offer to eliminate all personal debts (mortgages, loans, credit cards, etc) which all funding will be provided to Canada by the IMF under what will become known as the World Debt Reset program.\r\n\r\nIn exchange for acceptance of this total debt forgiveness the individual would forfeit ownership of any and all property and assets forever.\r\n\r\nThe individual would also have to agree to partake in the COVID-19 and COVID-21 vaccination schedule, which would provide the individual with unrestricted travel and unrestricted living even under a full lock down (through the use of photo identification referred to as Canada\'s HealthPass) .\r\n\r\nCommittee members asked who would become the owner of the forfeited property and assets in that scenario and what would happen to lenders or financial institutions, we were simply told \"the World Debt Reset program will handle all of the details\".\r\n\r\nSeveral committee members also questioned what would happen to individuals if they refused to participate in the World Debt Reset program, or the HealthPass, or the vaccination schedule, and the answer we got was very troubling. Essentially we were told it was our duty to make sure we came up with a plan to ensure that would never happen. We were told it was in the individuals best interest to participate.\r\n\r\nWhen several committee members pushed relentlessly to get an answer we were told that those who refused would first live under the lock down restrictions indefinitely.\r\n\r\nAnd that over a short period of time as more Canadians transitioned into the debt forgiveness program, the ones who refused to participate would be deemed a public safety risk and would be relocated into isolation facilities. Once in those facilities they would be given two options, participate in the debt forgiveness program and be released, or stay indefinitely in the isolation facility under the classification of a serious public health risk and have all their assets seized.\r\n\r\nSo as you can imagine after hearing all of this it turned into quite the heated discussion and escalated beyond anything I\'ve ever witnessed before.\r\n\r\nIn the end it was implied by the PMO that the whole agenda will move forward no matter who agrees with it or not.\r\n\r\nThat it wont just be Canada but in fact all nations will have similar roadmaps and agendas. That we need to take advantage of the situations before us to promote change on a grander scale for the betterment of everyone. The members who were opposed and ones who brought up key issues that would arise from such a thing were completely ignored. Our opinions and concerns were ignored. We were simply told to just do it.\r\n\r\nAll I know is that I don\'t like it and I think its going to place Canadians into a dark future.\r\n\r\nFull Link: https://thecanadianreport.ca/is-this-leaked-memo-really-trudeaus-covid-plan-for-2021-you-decide/\r\n\r\nAlternate Link: https://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message4551385/pg1?c1=1&c2=1&disclaimer=Continue\r\n\r\nYoutube Link based on email leak: Questions: What\'s Going On??? https://youtu.be/AzWLlfwfD4Y\r\n\r\nCanadian Government construction contract page to bid on building COVID \"isolation\" camps: http://web-old.archive.org/web/20201022044041/https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-data/tender-notice/PW-ZL-105-38463\r\n\r\nGov of Canada Announces Funding for voluntary self-isolation centre in Toronto: https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2020/09/government-of-canada-announces-funding-for-new-voluntary-self-isolation-centre-in-toronto.html\r\n\r\nJustin Trudeau\'s COVID-19 detention centres: What you need to know : https://youtu.be/u6I69M1iTKo\r\n\r\nJesus Christ Is Coming Back Soon So Repent of sin, pray, and have faith in Jesus Christ!\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/38928...

He is your NEW Best Friend and He Wants to Talk with you daily. \r\n　\r\n3) Make sure you find a christian church and get water Baptized, dunked under water, if you have been sprinkle baptized in the past it does NOT count. \r\n　\r\n4) Pray to be filled with the Holy Spirit, \"Sanctified\". You do this by praying, reading the Bible and living for Jesus. \r\n　\r\n5) take your King James Bible to church. When the preacher speaks, make sure what he says matches your Bible, it not, get up and walk out and find a new church. \r\n　\r\n6) ***VERY IMPORTANT*** Make SURE you REPENT of EVERY SIN you do now, ask Jesus to forgive you with an honest heart and He will. \r\n***If you would like me to pray with you or for you for ANYTHING, please message me and I will add you to my daily prayer list.

I married 2016 February 16. I was so happy about my marriage.  I brought my wife in USA 2017 oct 19. We used to have arguments most of the time. I don’t know she married me for green car or not. She used to lie to me lot. Some of her family was involved and some of my cousins. My cousin was not happy about my lifestyle and carrier improvement. I came to USA 10 year after my cousin. That’s why they were jealous. Finally talked about everything and everything became good. We were  going to visit Bangladesh for korbani eid aug 5 2019. After we arrived Bangladesh she was influenced by her family and problem started. I couldn’t take it anymore. So I filled divorce there. Main problem is my parents live with me. My parents are old. I can’t really let them go. They were threatening my family. I kind of escaped from Bangladesh. I was scared.  I send a email Dhaka embassy and uscis about what happened there. I reported my wife about possible marriage fraud. I didn’t receive any answers from Dhaka embassy or uscis.  So she stayed in Bangladesh. My wife’s father is been asking for forgiveness. I think they regret what they did. I think I will go back to her. Her green card is expired oct 19 2019. Her green card was conditional green card for 2 year spouse visa. I suppose to remove conditions oct 2019 after we come back from Bangladesh. Unfortunately accident happened. What is the process to bring her back? Do I have apply from beginning I-130 or i90 for replacement green card.? Please let me know. Thanks. Please don’t bring my name to news.', 1, NULL),

Testimonies and Experiences from those who took it: https://prezi.com/i/byzl22mqwfaa/compilation-of-cv-experiences/\r\n\r\nBiggest consensus from this info is to not take the vax. Its very dangerous! Why take a vaccine when COVID survival rate is above 99%? The media focuses on cases rather than deaths....why is that? Also, there are more deaths overall relating to other fatalities/diseases (cancer, heart problems, etc) than there is COVID. This is not a \"vaccine\", this is an mRNA shot. It changes your DNA for the worse, not better.\r\n\r\nYou can’t sue Pfizer or Moderna if you have severe Covid vaccine side effects. The government likely won’t compensate you for damages either\r\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/covid-vaccine-side-effects-compensation-lawsuit.html\r\n\r\nWho is Tiffany Dover?

Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.\r\n\r\nIf you take the Mark of the Beast, this is what happens:\r\nRevelation 14:9-11 King James Version (KJV)\r\n9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,\r\n10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:\r\n11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.\r\n\r\nIf you refuse the Mark of the Beast, this is what happens\r\nRevelation 20:4 King James Version (KJV)\r\n4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.\r\n\r\nRepent of your sins, trust and have faith in Jesus Christ, read your Bible, and be water baptised in Jesus name.\r\n\r\nFree Bible link: https://my.bible.com/bible/1/MAT.1.KJV\r\n\r\nTo truly know what will happen in the end days, read the revelation portion of the Bible. Here is the link to that, its a very short read (22 pages in total): https://www.bible.com/bible/1/REV.1.KJV\r\n\r\nFor God so Loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have Everlasting Life. -John 3:16 KJV\r\n\r\nJesus saith unto him: \"I AM The Way, The Truth and The Life, no man (no one) cometh to The Father but by Me.\" -John 14:6 KJV\r\n\r\nThat if thou shalt confess with thy mouth The Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. -Romans 10:9,10 KJV\r\n\r\nWhosoever denieth The Son, the same hath not The Father; he that acknowledgeth The Son hath The Father also. -1 John 2:23 KJV\r\n\r\nWhosoever shall confess that Jesus is The Son of God, God dwelleth in him and he in God. -1 John 4:15 KJV\r\n\r\nHe that believeth on The Son of God hath the witness in himself; he that believeth not God hath made Him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of His Son.\r\nAnd this is the record, that God hath given to us Eternal Life, and this Life is in His Son.\r\nHe that hath The Son hath Life; and he that hath not The Son of God hath not Life.\r\n-1 John 5:10-12 KJV\r\n\r\nAnd from Jesus Christ, who is The Faithful Witness, and The First begotten of the dead, and The Prince of the kings of the earth. Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own Blood and hath made us kings and priests unto God and His Father; to Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever Amen. -Revelation 1:5 and 6 KJV\r\n\r\nBe it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by The Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by Him doth this man stand here before you whole. This is The Stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the Head of the Corner. Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other Name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. Acts 4:10-12 KJV\r\n\r\nWherefore God also hath highly exalted Him, and given Him a Name which is above every name; That at The Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God The Father. -Philippians 2:9-11 KJV\r\n\r\nThe Bible says:\r\nAnd I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, \"Now salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren, who accused them before God day and night, has been cast down.\r\nAnd they overcame him by The Blood of The Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. - Revelation 12:10,11 KJV', 1, NULL),

Do you understand what I am saying? Truly the hour is here when you must prepare to make the choice to remain fully human, infused with My Spirit. The enemy wants nothing more than to deceive you through propaganda, fear and manipulation and cause you to allow either a mark or an implant (vaccine or digital tattoo) into your bodies that will forever separate you from Me. This is your reality right now! You must know what you will choose to do.\r\n\r\nWhen you open doors to the enemy through sin and through your choices in life outside of My ways, the demonic spirits appoint gatekeepers over your heart, your mind, and your soul. Then those spirits invite more, and when no repentance occurs, strongholds occur. The heart of an unregenerate man is wicked and deceitful above all things. But My Word is quick, powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing apart of your soul and spirit, your joints and marrow, as I discern the thoughts and intentions of your heart. Allow Me to write My laws on your heart and you will know truth at last. You will know what is now directly in front of you and the choices that are here for you and your loved ones. My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, but it does NOT have to be this way. Allow My glory to penetrate your spirit so that your soul will come under submission. To not allow this, means you will remain in bondage and you will be easily deceived. If I do not dwell in you fully, and your gates have been breached, another will easily influence you and take governance.\r\n\r\nMy people, I have given you the keys to the Kingdom. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in Heaven and whatever is loosed on earth will be loosed in Heaven. Bind the strongman, bind the strongholds on your life and be delivered!\r\n\r\nThe technology for the mark of the beast is here. It is upon you. It will be presented at first to be taken voluntarily, then very soon after, you will not be able to buy, sell or work. Do not wait another moment. Come out of Babylon and make Me King of your heart, the Divine Gatekeeper of your soul.\r\n\r\nThe evil ones have set in motion their wicked schemes, as it must be so according to My Word. Many, many judgments will occur as I allow them. This is to wake up My church. You must know where you stand in your walk with Me, because in an instant, everything will change, and there will not be another opportunity to choose, because the choice will be made for you. You are either all in, or I am turning you over to your carnal mind and nature. You have the choice My loves, choose life and eternity in Me over eternal death in darkness. \r\n\r\nThe time is now..\r\n\r\nYAHUSHUA  (JESUS)\r\n\r\n\r\n#2 You Must CHOOSE NOW to NOT Take the MARK or VACCINE\r\nCryptic1  Message given 8/9/2020\r\n\r\nThere will be a great shaking all across the land. It is coming. All will know who I AM is then. In those days many will cry out to Me. Have I not given out warning upon warning and still many of My own have not prepared? Seek Me now while I may be found. Seek Me wholeheartedly in My Word, in worship, in kneeling before Me in repentance – I will be found. Time is short. Time is precious. Use it wisely for it is on the move – passing -never to return. Many will cry out to Me in that day. Is it not better to call out to Me now while I am here?\r\n\r\nCHILDREN THE TIME IS COME TO CHOOSE – TO TAKE THE VACCINE OR NOT – TO TAKE OF THE MARK OR NOT. NOW IS THE TIME. NOW IS THE HOUR. DO NOT WAIT UNTIL IT IS AT YOUR DOOR –FOR IT WILL BE TOO LATE FOR MANY OF YOU. MANY WILL BUCKLE AND CAVE IN TO THE DEMANDS OF THE ENEMY. WHEN THERE IS NO FOOD, NO HOME, NO MONEY – IT WILL BE HARDER TO STAND AND EASIER TO TAKE THE MARK AND THE VACCINE. YOU MUST STAND BEFORE ME NOW AND SUBMIT YOUR WILL TO MY WILL. ALLOW ME TO LEAD YOU AND GUIDE YOU CHILDREN. THERE WILL BE MUCH SUFFERING BUT IT WILL BE GREATER (SUFFERING) WITHOUT ME. CHOOSE NOW. CHOOSE LIFE WITH ME AND FORSAKE THIS WORLD AND ITS’ TRAPPINGS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE HEAVENLY KINGDOM I OFFER – OR CHOOSE DEATH. ETERNAL DEATH I SAY – FOR ONCE YOU TAKE OF THE MARK YOU ARE AS DEAD TO ME FOR YOUR SOUL WILL BE LOST TO ME ETERNALLY FOREVER.\r\n\r\nI have said to persevere until the end. I have said there would be tribulation. I have said that anyone who does not give up father or mother or their loved ones is not worthy of My Kingdom and to sit at My right hand. Only the Father knows the day and the hour so prepare, prepare for all that is coming.\r\n\r\nGround your hearts in Me – the firm foundation of Truth. Many will be caught up even now in the lies and deception of the evil one. I am the Way, I am the Truth, I am the light of the world. Come follow Me children. Persevere to the end. I will be with you always. Guard your hearts. Forgive your enemies. Keep your garments white and pure. Be holy as I am Holy.\r\n\r\nI come upon the clouds of glory for My own.\r\n\r\nYour Savior Lord and King\r\n\r\nYeshua\r\n\r\n\r\n#3 Covid-19 Vaccinations MEAN DEATH! Esther Eagle\r\nMarch 3, 2020\r\n\r\nI was praying and fasting, regarding the Covid-19 vaccine during the time I’ve received this dream:\r\n\r\nIn my dream, God took me into the near future of America. I was overlooking America (like a birds eye view), and I looked to my right of America (the Eastside) and was overlooking New York State as well.. And I saw millions of people in America, had received the Covid-19 vaccine.\r\n\r\nAnd also throughout America, I could see 5G towers monitoring VERY closely the covid-19 vaccinated individuals (victims).\r\n\r\nWhen I saw this, I immediately asked God, “How are they completely connected to these 5G towers and the towers to them?” Right after I asked God this, He took me to a hospital in New York. There, I saw a doctor giving a patient, the covid-19 vaccine. (The doctor and patient couldn’t see me.)\r\nBut while the doctor was injecting into the patient’s arm, the covid-19 vaccine shot.. I saw hundreds/thousands of little specs of microchips, [nanobots] INSIDE the covid-19 vaccine, flowing through the shot, and into that individual.\r\n\r\nAs the dream went on,\r\nOne thing got my attention immediately..was that the people who’d taken the Covid-19 vaccine, their whole body was glowing an odd color green. I asked God, “What does this mean?” And I saw the word, “radioactive”.\r\n\r\nAND, upon seeing this..I also saw that they had extra super dark energy-that is, super demonic energy- attached to them!\r\n\r\nAlso, the word “LEGION”…was written all over them as well!\r\n\r\nThe Lord took my up higher in the dream (again birds eye view, but over looking America). And the million’s of people, who’d priorly were covid-19 vaccinated and being controlled by the 5G towers.. BEGAN to grow to be VERY violent and AGGRESSIVE, VERY beast like..\r\nIn fact, the news called it, “An outbreak” and that those same people (those with covid-19 vaccine in their blood) were deemed “INCURABLE”.\r\n\r\nThese (covid-19) vaccinated individuals, where EVERYWHERE (when the “outbreak” occurred)! There was NO LINE they weren’t willing to cross, (be it in, violence, murder, mayhem, ravaging, etc). . They were COMPLETELY and UTTERLY out of hand!\r\n\r\nI was taken to a very disturbing scene:\r\n\r\nA major city, in the mid-eastern side of America.. were infested with “incurables”..They were literally running all over-many on all fours-just like beasts! They were running out of a city, that they had priorly taken over, (I saw thousands laying dead all over the streets of that city.. the smell and sight was HORRIBLE!)\r\n\r\nI saw then, that the same (CV-19 vaccinated) crazed “incurables” were ALL at war, with the EVERBODY, including the U.S. military! Looking down at the outskirts in this same city, it was a scene of COMPLETE utter confusion, torment and chaos!\r\nThe US military soldiers were in the thousands, and armed with machine guns etc, were shooting (by the droves), all “infected” on sight!\r\n\r\nThe “infected” (so full of legion within themselves; in the hundreds of thousands), were throwing metal objects, rocks-whatever they could find-all against the U.S. Military..the “infected” were even jumping off of vehicles (they’d jump as high as 8-10 in the air) and tall objects to gain ground against the U.S. Military..\r\n\r\nThe “infected”, didn’t care to loose their own lives either!\r\n(As before mentioned..”there was no line they weren’t willing to cross..”)\r\n\r\nI saw these “incurable” (CV-19 vaccinated) people were in the millions, everywhere in America, they were burning up, homes, cities, towns, neighborhoods..\r\n\r\nDuring this “OUTBREAK”..that resulted throughout the U.S. Martial Law was issued, as the military soldiers each had orders to: “Shoot ALL incurables/infected ON SIGHT!”\r\n\r\nThe soldiers had to be in gathered in large groups at a time and use special automatic machine guns..because it literally took LOTS of bullets just to kill one “incurable” on sight. .\r\n\r\nIt was far worse on the East side of America too, especially because of the “most infected” cities there (as the media put it)..\r\n\r\nRight then, seeing all this, I heard the Lord repeat 3x’s: “Covid-19 Vaccinations MEAN DEATH!”\r\n\r\n*Note: I told myself, for the Lord to use the word, “Death”..I knew strongly in my spirit, He meant, ‘Eternal death’.\r\n\r\n#4 What the Mark is like\r\nMarch 29, 2020\r\n\r\nDaughter of God\r\nI got to experience in this dream what it would be like to receive the mark of the beast.\r\n\r\nDream:\r\n\r\nThere was 2 of me and we were standing in a tent where a nurse was giving vaccinations. I had a choice to take the vaccine or not. I said “I don’t want that, it could be the mark of the beast.” The nurse reassured me saying “no it’s not, it’s just a vaccine, just a precursor to the mark, it’s nothing”. The other me said “I’ll go first, don’t be a chicken, it’s nothing”. Then I started seeing through her eyes. For the rest of the dream I was in that other version of me that chose to take the mark. I believe God was showing me this so I could see what it is like and warn others. It’s going to get real dark and disturbing from here so I wont even tell all the details of it.\r\n\r\nOk so the nurse pulled out a tattooing device and tattooed me in the center of my forehead. I barely felt it and looked in the mirror to see if it was done and I saw a circular pattern of quantum dots. They glowed white. About 2 cm diameter. Then the nurse got me to draw a symbol. I knew the symbol was to seal the deal. It seemed to be some kind of witchcraft symbol. It had a triangular shape at the top with a spiral under it. I won’t draw it again to show you, for obvious reasons. Remember it wasn’t me doing it, I was like an observer but seeing through her eyes with no control of what was happening.\r\n\r\nThen I felt demons attach to me, one on each side and I felt changed. I felt Holy Spirit and love leave me and my heart felt empty and dead. It scared me, the nothingness inside, like a void that can’t be filled. It felt so cold. But I felt powerful and had superpowers but they were like magic, like witchcraft powers. I went out to test them out. I could wave my hand over things to repair them and I could jump through portals to other places. I was hanging out with the rich and famous. They all had the mark too. I felt an immense pride and superiority over “regular” humans. I felt no empathy whatsoever. This must be what a psychopath feels. I was killing people like it was nothing. I’ll stop there. You get the point: The mark made me evil in the dream. It made me sick, (the real me), I knew at was wrong but couldn’t stop it. I actually repented when I woke up because the dream disturbed me so much. It was nothing like me in real life. In real life I have a big heart and love and care for others and I’m not proud at all. I’m just a humble servant for God. I never want to experience anything like that again.\r\n\r\nDon’t take the vaccine, it is the mark and will turn you into a monster. You’re better off dying than taking this mark.\r\n\r\nI asked God for a confirmation of this dream and He gave me this scripture :\r\n\r\nFor we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. – Ephesians 6:12,13\r\n\r\nGod bless\r\n\r\n#5 SO BE IT!\r\nSeptember 29, 2020\r\nOnly A Grain Of Sand\r\n\r\nI AM gave you the Ten Commandments as The Law. You repudiated them entirely, slowly, over time making them a mockery and or an enforced private predilection, or illegal and a hate crime.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nI AM send My Only Begotten Son Jesus The Christ to offer His Life & Blood as an efficacious Sacrifice for your sins, and the sins of your forefathers (individual & collective). You rejected Him and made your self gods.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nI AM gave you the Bible, My Holy Word in the Old & New Testaments, the inspired Word of the Holy Spirit. You edited it, miss-translated it, re-wrote it, cut and pasted it, re-interpreted it, cut out books from it, made it gender neutral, hated it, dismissed it, forgot it, treated it like fiction or a novel, refused to honor it, burned it, trampled on it, used it in satanic rites, accepted it in part, spit on it.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nI AM sent the prophets, many watchmen and watchwomen to you. But you scorned them, rejected, murdered, ignored, laughed at, dismissed, silenced, or quibbled at their every word, arguing about semantics, the dot-and-tittle, dissected the grammar and mocked My Words to your perdition.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nI AM heard your grumbling, rejection, detestation of My Divine Will, making your human will an idol, worshiped by all the nations of the world.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou destroyed My Little Ones (Abortion). Grinding them up, sucking them out of the womb live, pulverizing them into a bloody mush, murdering them after they came out of the womb. Selling their body parts, daubing them as cosmetics on your faces, using their glands as drugs for the elites, discarding their bodies in dumpsters, using them in food as sweeteners and genetic research.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou changed girls into boys, and boys into girls and altered the definition of masculinity and femininity, marriage, family, and made your bodies which are Temples Of The Holy Spirit into debased animalistic idols. You ran after and lusted for strange flesh and My Creation, the animal kingdom, as your sexual partners without shame or remorse.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou made idols of the rich and famous and media stars making them gods of the cult of personality, worshiping their every word, gesture and action fornicating with satan, as you danced after the damned.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou made a religion out of your country, your national pride, your wealth, power your hegemony world-wide as The Hammer of All. With military might controlled all the peoples of the earth with wars, assassinations, coupes, extortion, domination, threats, sanctions, invasions, secret operations, drugs, sale of weapons of mass destruction, financial manipulations of currency, stocks & bonds, precious metals, international treaties, deals under the table, pornography, child trafficking, slave labor, abductions, and violent (god-of-forces) medias.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou have now turned your attention to making child sex and cannibalism legal.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou exported a Corporate/Industrial/Commercial Complex to destroy and overpower all the indigenous cultures, peoples of the earth to make a homogeneous one world way of life of commercialism, materialism, with a secular humanistic world view on the road to openly worshiping the snake king. A world view that has obliterated the unique way of life of cultures that have existed and formerly flourished for thousands of years.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou have duplicated and followed the paths of all of the former world civilizations of the past. Initial germination, vigorous youth and strength, morality, peace and justice, beginnings of great abundance and wealth, aggression and domination of neighbors, the first signs of decadence and perversion, internal strife, weakness, exhaustion, collapse and now final annihilation.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou worshiped your kings. Raising them to godhead. Putting your total faith in an man, instead of God, believing their lies and tricks, and playing a political two party system that has transfixed your your people for countless generations and divided you against your neighbor, in a useless game of Divide & Conquer, leading to chaos, riot, carnage, destruction and now to murder.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou chose a Culture of Death over Life. You chose Hell over Heaven.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou Chose Today Over Tomorrow. Exchanging the gift of eternal life offered to you by a Loving Creator God The Father for and eternity with the snake king, in a lake of fire with no love, peace, light, joy or pause.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou bartered your inheritance for a mess of potage, for a dish of lentils you threw away a glorious legacy of a never ending future of unlimited horizons.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou chose Night (secret sins, thefts, hidden addictions, whispered lies, gossip, calumny, unforgiveness rehearsed for never-ending years, occult perversions) over Day (godly transparency, honesty, strait forwardness, upright actions, truth).\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou scorned, laughed at modesty, virginity, decency, destroying the youth of multiple generation with sex, drugs, rock-n-roll.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou legalized gambling, prostitution, promoting addictions, obsessions, compromising individuals, families, marriages, building underworld empires and sin-cities of satan, like Los Vegas & Atlantic City, which will both be soon destroyed.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou elevated Sport to a false religion, destroying youth in the bloom of their vigor with obsessive ambition for extravagant wealth and lust for fame, who worship at an evil altar instead of making their dedication, talent, hard work towards a career, a balanced part of their lives.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou let the MSM tell you what to think, what to buy, what to say, what to love, what to hate, what to obey, what to worship.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou accept the lies and dictates of corrupt and satanically oriented politicians who are bent on your own destruction, and sacrifice their own flesh (sons & daughters) to satan.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou follow after an occult based popular culture taking their diabolically dedicated products into your homes and filling your eyes, ears, mouths with its rancid filth, death, and destruction.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou choose satan, the snake king, the devil, the man of perdition, the anti-Christ, over God The Father, God The Son, God The Holy Spirit.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou choose yourself over your families, your loves ones, your neighbors, your God.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou choose to put off today, what you know should be done to prepare for the Great Tribulation, that is now at your door-step.\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nYou decided this message is the ravings of a lunatic, a false or deluded person who needs to be more tolerant, mind their own business, get-a-job, just plain shut-up, go away, be silent, forget it, change the channel, get lost, go to jail, be reported, locked up, forcibly stopped!\r\nSO BE IT!\r\n\r\nThe Sun Went Down, The Day & Night Came & A Darkness Covered The Earth & All The Peoples Of The World Made Their Final Decision YES Or NO To Their God!\r\nSO BE IT!', 1, NULL),

পরীক্ষা হবে আগামী ৩ নভেম্বর। ডোনাল্ড ট্রাম্প সব সময়ই নিজেকে শক্তিশালী নেতার ভাবমূর্তিতে রাঙাতে চেয়েছেন। চীন বা রাশিয়া কিংবা উত্তর কোরিয়ার নেতাদের চেয়ে তিনি কত শক্তিশালী, তা বোঝাতে কতই না হাস্যকৌতুকের জন্ম দিয়ে চলেছেন। করোনাও যে তাঁর কিছুই করতে পারবে না, তা বোঝাতে একবার হাসপাতাল থেকে বেরিয়ে আরেকবার হোয়াইট হাউসের বারান্দায় দর্শন দিয়ে ভক্তদের চমকে দিলেন। প্রথম মেয়াদে শক্তিশালী ট্রাম্প চান দ্বিতীয় মেয়াদে আরও শক্তিমান হয়ে হাজির হতে। কিন্তু  রিএনফোর্সড  ট্রাম্প জয়ের শিরোপা পেলে বাংলাদেশের মতো দেশের জন্য তা ভালো না মন্দ, সেই প্রশ্ন মাথায় আসতেই পারে। প্রশ্নটা আদার ব্যাপারীর জাহাজের খবর নেওয়া বলা যাবে না। কারণ, যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের অভ্যন্তরীণ রাজনীতি আমাদের মতো দেশের পররাষ্ট্রনীতি শুধু নয়, রাজনীতিকেও প্রভাবিত করে।</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ট্রাম্পের পক্ষে প্রথম কথা হলো, তিনি কোনো যুদ্ধ করেননি। বারাক ওবামা শান্তিতে নোবেল পুরস্কারের মুকুট মাথায় নিয়ে লিবিয়া ও সিরিয়ায় যুদ্ধ শুরু করেছিলেন, ইরাক ও আফগানিস্তানে সামরিক আগ্রাসন টিকিয়ে রেখেছিলেন। সুবেশী ও সুদর্শন ক্লিনটন ওবামারা বেয়াড়া বুশদের চালানো যুদ্ধের জের টেনে গেছেন। বৈশ্বিক সুশীল সমাজের কাছে গ্রহণযোগ্য হিলারি ক্লিনটন ওবামার পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রী থেকে যুদ্ধবাজ আয়োজনেই ব্যস্ত ছিলেন। ট্রাম্পের বদলে তিনি প্রেসিডেন্ট হলে ইরান আক্রমণের সম্ভাবনা বেড়ে যেত বলে অনেক বিশ্লেষকই সে সময় মত দেন।</p>\r\n\r\n<p>সেদিক থেকে দেখলে, ট্রাম্প ইরাক ও আফগানিস্তান থেকে সৈন্য সরিয়েছেন। আফগান সরকারের সঙ্গে তালেবানদের শান্তি আলোচনাও হতে পারছে ট্রাম্প প্রশাসনেরই সবুজ সংকেতে। সিরিয়া থেকেও সরে আসার পথে ছিলেন ট্রাম্প। ইরান নিয়ে তম্বি করলেও হম্বি করেননি হামলা চালাননি। ট্রাম্পের একলা চলো নীতির জন্য ইরানের অস্ত্র কেনার ওপর অবরোধের মেয়াদ শেষে হতে চললেও নতুন অবরোধে রাজি করাতে পারেননি আন্তর্জাতিক সম্প্রদায়কে। ইরান এখন চীন ও রাশিয়ার কাছ থেকে অস্ত্র বৈধভাবেই কিনতে পারবে। ট্রাম্পের আমলে চীনকে ঘিরে সামরিক আয়োজন চললেও মধ্যপ্রাচ্যের দেশগুলোতে নতুন কোনো যুদ্ধ চাপানো হয়নি। পুনর্নির্বাচিত যদি তিনি হনও, তখনো এই আশঙ্কা কম</p>\r\n\r\n<p>| কিন্তু জাপান ও ভারত বাইডেনকে নিয়ে চিন্তিত। বাইডেনের ঘোষিত কার্যতালিকায় চীনকে সামরিকভাবে মোকাবিলার কথা নেই। জাপান, তাইওয়ান, ভিয়েতনাম, ফিলিপাইন ও ভারতের আন্তর্জাতিক বিশ্লেষকেরা এ কথাটাই গণমাধ্যমে তুলে যাচ্ছেন। বাইডেন যদি চীনের সঙ্গে সমঝোতা করে রাশিয়ার সঙ্গে টানাটানিতে লিপ্ত হন, তাতে এশিয়ার বর্তমান নিরাপত্তাব্যবস্থা আগের মতো না ও থাকতে পারে। ইসরায়েলের কথায় চলেও ট্রাম্প কিন্তু মধ্যপ্রাচ্যকে দম ফেলার সুযোগ দিয়েছেন। বাইডেন তা না ও করতে পারেন। এশিয়া ও পাশ্চাত্যের বন্ধুদের আশ্বস্ত করতে বাইডেন অবশ্য চীনের মানবাধিকার লঙ্ঘনের বিরুদ্ধে কঠোর কথা বলেছেন, বাণিজ্যে চীনকে পেছনে ফেলার কথা বলেছেন। মার্কিন পত্রিকা ফরেন পলিসির ভাষায় বললে, বাইডেন হয়তো চীনের ব্যাপারে কঠোর, কিন্তু নতুন শীতলযুদ্ধ তিনি চান না।</p>\r\n<p>ট্রাম্প আমেরিকার ব্যবসায়ী লবির প্রতিনিধি। অস্ত্র কোম্পানির প্রতিনিধি তাঁকে বলা যায় না। মধ্যপ্রাচ্যে তিনি আপাতশান্তি চান, যাতে করে ইরাক সিরিয়া এবং আফগানিস্তানে মার্কিন ঠিকাদার কোম্পানিগুলো পুনর্গঠনের ব্যবসা চালাতে পারে। তিনি জেরুজালেমকে ইসরায়েলের হাতে তুলে দিয়ে ফিলিস্তিনে উন্নয়ন দিতে চেয়েছিলেন। চীন ও রাশিয়ার সঙ্গে ব্যবসাতেই তাঁর আগ্রহ বেশি। হ্যাঁ, একটা যুদ্ধ তিনি করেছেন, সেটা হলো চীনের সঙ্গে বাণিজ্যযুদ্ধ। তাতে কিছু মার্কিনের চাকরি বেঁচেছে। এটা ঠিক, ট্রাম্প মার্কিন দেশে ব্যক্তিগত বন্দুকের অধিকার কমাতে রাজি ছিলেন না, কিন্তু যুদ্ধবাজ র যাম্বোর বদলে মার্কিন প্রেসিডেন্টের ইমেজ হয়ে দাঁড়িয়েছিল কমেডিয়ানের। এবারের নির্বাচনী বিতর্কেও দেখা যায়, ইরান বা চীন কিংবা রাশিয়া অথবা মুসলিম জঙ্গিবাদ নয়, আমেরিকা ব্যস্ত তার ঘরের সমস্যা নিয়ে। বর্ণবাদ, বেকারত্ব, স্বাস্থ্যব্যবস্থা ইত্যাদি ছিল ইস্যু।</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ইতিহাস আমাদের বিভিন্নভাবে শিক্ষা দেয়। সেই শিক্ষা এই: নেতা যত শক্তিশালী হন, তত দুর্বল হয় দেশ, গণতন্ত্র নামকাওয়াস্তে হয়ে যায়। ট্রাম্প শক্তিশালী হতে গিয়ে আমেরিকাকে যে দুর্বল করেছেন, তাতে মার্কিনবিরোধীরা খুশি হতে পারেন। তবে ডেমোক্র্যাট প্রার্থী জো বাইডেন প্রেসিডেন্ট হওয়া মানে আরও আরও আমেরিকান নাগরিকের বিদেশের ফ্রন্টে যুদ্ধ করতে গিয়ে নিহত বা পঙ্গু হওয়া। ট্রাম্প সৌদি আরব ও ভারতের কাছে বিপুল অস্ত্র বিক্রির মওকা করে দেওয়ার পরও কিন্তু অস্ত্র কোম্পানিগুলোর স্পষ্ট সমর্থন তাঁর পক্ষে দেখা যায়নি। ট্রাম্পও হোয়াইট হাউসের গুরুত্বপূর্ণ কোনো পদে অস্ত্র কোম্পানির সঙ্গে জড়িত কাউকে বসাননি। যেখানে বাইডেনের সঙ্গে ঘনিষ্ঠভাবে আছেন অস্ত্র ব্যবসায়ীদের লোক।</p>\r\n\r\n<p>তবে ট্রাম্পের বিজয় ভারতের জন্য খুব প্রয়োজন। শুধু ভারত নয়, বিশ্বের সব পপুলিস্ট অগণতান্ত্রিক নেতাই চাইবেন, তাঁদের গোত্রের কেউই দুনিয়ার এক নম্বর পরাশক্তির ক্ষমতার আসনে বসুন। বাইডেনের জয় ভারতের বর্তমান শাসক দলের জন্য চিন্তার বিষয় হতে পারে। ব্ল্যাক লাইভস ম্যাটার আন্দোলনসহ মার্কিন প্রগতিশীলদের সমর্থন রয়েছে বাইডেনের ওপর। তারা বাইডেন প্রশাসনকে প্রভাবিত করবে যেকোনো রকম ডানপন্থী শাসকদের ওপর চাপ তৈরি করতে। ভারত আমেরিকার বৃহত্তম অস্ত্রের বাজার, এশিয়ায় চীনকে মোকাবিলায় ভারত ও আমেরিকার পরস্পরকে দরকার। কিন্তু বাইডেনের প্রশাসন চাইবে না তাদের বড় মিত্র হোমফ্রন্টে সংখ্যালঘু নির্যাতন করে যাক কিংবা সংবিধান বদলে ধর্মীয় রাষ্ট্রের চেহারা নিক। কিন্তু সে ক্ষেত্রেও ভারতীয় বংশোদ্ভূত কমলা হ্যারিস বিজেপির জন্য আশীর্বাদ হয়ে আসতে পারেন।</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ট্রাম্প শিবির বাইডেনকে ওয়াকিং ডেড বা হাঁটাচলা করা লাশ বলে পরিহাস করে শুধু এ কারণেই না যে তাঁর বয়স এখন প্রায় ৭৮পরের নির্বাচনের সময় হবে ৮২, এ কারণেও যে তিনি এক মেয়াদের বেশি ক্ষমতায় থাকতে চান না। আমেরিকার রাজনৈতিক ঐতিহ্য মোতাবেক ধরে নেওয়া যায়, বাইডেন জিতলে পরেরবারের প্রেসিডেন্ট প্রার্থী হবেন কমলা হ্যারিস। আর তাঁর পেছনে থাকবেন ওবামা পেলোসির মতো প্রভাবশালী নেতারা। শুধু ভারতীয় আমেরিকানরাই নয়, কমলাকে নিয়ে খাঁটি ভারতীয়রাও খুশি হবেন। সে কারণেও বোধ হয়, ট্রাম্প মোদি দোস্তালি সত্ত্বেও অধিকাংশ ভারতীয় আমেরিকান বাইডেনের পক্ষে বলে জানাচ্ছে সাম্প্রতিক মার্কিন জনমত জরিপের ফল।</p>\r\n\r\n<p>মার্কিন যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের নেতৃত্বে যে ই আসুক, এশিয়ার জন্য সুখবর নেই। বাইডেনের প্রশাসন গণতন্ত্র ও মানবাধিকার নিয়ে ভাবিত থাকবে, এটুকুই যা লাভ। কিন্তু আমেরিকা তখনই কোনো দেশের মানবাধিকার ও গণতন্ত্র চর্চা নিয়ে মাথাব্যথা করে, যদি সেই দেশটিকে তার কাবু করবার দরকার হয়। সুতরাং দিনের শেষে ট্রাম্পই জিতুন আর বাইডেন জিতুন, আদার ব্যাপারীরা শান্তির জাহাজের খবর পাবে না।</p>', '2020-10-07', 1, '', 492, 'zMl12CUhMqw'),
